### Server setup

In order to test/deploy the app you have to run the flask server.

Make sure you have flask and flask-assets installed and all other libraries.

```
$ pip install Flask
$ pip install Flask-Assets
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Then go to Project_k/server/flask and run:

```
$ python3 flask_server.py
```

You will then be able to connect to the server on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ by default.
